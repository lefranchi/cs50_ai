# Harvard CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python

This repository contains materials, code, and resources from Harvard's CS50 course on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
with Python. The course covers fundamental concepts of AI while providing hands-on programming experience with Python.

## Course Topics

The course focuses on key areas of Artificial Intelligence, including:

- **Search Algorithms** (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, A* Search)
- **Knowledge Representation** (e.g., Propositional Logic and Semantic Networks)
- **Uncertainty** (e.g., Bayesian Networks)
- **Optimization** (e.g., Constraint Satisfaction Problems)
- **Learning** (e.g., Supervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning)
- **Natural Language Processing** (NLP)

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders and files such as:

- `seacrh/` — Content related to the chapter on search algorithms.
- `knowledge/` — Content related to the chapter on knowledge representation.
- `uncertainty/` — Content related to the chapter on reasoning under uncertainty.
- `learning/` — Content related to the chapter on machine learning.
- `README.md` — File providing an overview of the repository (this file).

## Prerequisites

This course assumes some prior programming experience, ideally with Python. Familiarity with basic mathematics (
particularly linear algebra, probability, and statistics) is also recommended.

## Installation and Usage
